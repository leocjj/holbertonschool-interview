# 0x0D. Array to AVL

Function that builds an AVL tree from an array

Prototype: avl_t *sorted_array_to_avl(int *array, size_t size);
Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to be converted
And size is the number of element in the array
Your function must return a pointer to the root node of the created AVL tree, or NULL on failure
You can assume there will be no duplicate value in the array
You are not allowed to rotate
You can only have 3 functions in your file
