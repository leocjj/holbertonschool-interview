# 0x18. Merge Sort

Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm:

Prototype: void merge_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You must implement the top-down merge sort algorithm

When you divide an array into two sub-arrays, the size of the left array should always be <= the size of the right array. i.e. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} -> {1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}

Sort the left array before the right array
You are allowed to use printf
You are allowed to use malloc and free only once (only one call)
